        <div class="content">
            <h2>Status: Unconfirmed</h2>
            <p>RFAC-054, known as "The Divine End," represents the highest level of anomalous power identified by the Foundation. Its existence remains a subject of intense debate and investigation. Due to its nature and implications, the potential effects of this anomaly could be catastrophic.</p>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>RFAC-054 is believed to embody the ultimate culmination of cosmic and metaphysical forces. If it were to be confirmed as real, it possesses the capability to bring about the absolute conclusion of all existence. Theoretical assessments suggest that the activation of RFAC-054 could lead to the annihilation of both humanity and the galaxy, resulting in an end of all matter, energy, and potentially transcending beyond the known universe.</p>
            <h2>Current Status</h2>
            <p>To date, there is no conclusive evidence proving the existence of RFAC-054. The anomaly remains theoretical, with no tangible data or observations confirming its reality. Ongoing investigations are focused on gathering more information and conducting thorough analyses to determine if RFAC-054 is an actual threat or merely a product of speculation.</p>
            <h2>Potential Impact</h2>
            <p>Should RFAC-054 be verified, the consequences would be unprecedented. Its activation could result in the total destruction of the world and the galaxy, potentially leading to the extinction of all known forms of life and the disintegration of the very fabric of existence.</p>
            <p>As of now, the anomaly's status is marked as "???," indicating the profound uncertainty surrounding its reality and potential. The Foundation continues to prioritize the investigation of RFAC-054 while preparing for any eventuality should the anomaly prove to be genuine.</p>
